# Advent of Code 2025 Solutions and Runner

Merry [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025) to those who celebrate!

For 2025 I am doing something a little different than [past years](https://github.com/delventhalz/advent-of-code-2024). With no more global leaderboard and only 12 days of puzzles, this is a good time to stop focusing on solve times and instead practice a new language. I have been teaching myself Go for a side project, so this year the runner and puzzle solutions will all be written in Go.

## Usage

TBD

## Leaderboard

In past years I have competed on [caderek](https://github.com/caderek)'s leaderboard. Although I am not going to be as focused on solve times this time, I will stay on the leaderboard this year as well. You can join yourself with this code:
